# Problem Set: User Input

This section contains a number of selected problems for the User Input section.

It is recommended that you review the problems, and complete a few before
moving on to the next section.

## Problem #1: Repeat After Me

You're a pretty rad person. You want your computer to be rad too.

Create a program where the computer asks you what it should say,
and then ``||game:game.splash||``es your response.

## Problem #2: You Said This

You want to keep a log of things that you say.

Create a program where the computer asks you for input,
and ``console.log`` what you say,
but add the phrase "You said " before what you actually said.

## Problem #3: (Repeatedly) Repeat After Me

You often find yourself repeating the same thing over and over again. 

Create a program where the computer asks you what it should say,
but this time, make it so the program ``||game:game.splash||``s your response **twice**.

## Problem #4: Animal Kingdom

You want your computer to learn about the animal kingdom.
Create a program that allows you to "teach" your computer.

It should first ``||game:ask||`` for an animal name. After you respond,
the computer should ``||game:ask||`` you what sound this animal makes
(this prompt should include the name of the animal you first described).
After you respond again, the program should repeat back to you "The ``animal``
goes ``sound``", with ``animal`` being your first response,
and ``sound`` being your second response.

## Problem #5: You Said, They Said

You and a friend want to keep a log of your conversation.
Create a program that will do this for you.

The program should first ask for your name,
followed by your friend's name.

Then, it should ``||game:ask||`` first what you said,
and then ask what your friend said.
Finally, the computer should ``console.log`` a transcript of the conversation
(for example, "James: What's your favorite color?", "Julia: My favorite color is green.").

**Challenge:** record a longer portion of the conversation,
by asking what each person said (and then logging that) multiple times.
