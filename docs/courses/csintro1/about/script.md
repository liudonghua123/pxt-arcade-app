# Programming Language

In this course, we commonly refer to the language being used as JavaScript, but this is a slight misnomer. The language we use has significant similarities to JavaScript, but there are a few differences to ease students into programming as a whole, rather than focusing solely on JavaScript. This language is called [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and MakeCode uses a simplified form of it, see the [Programming Language Documentation](https://www.makecode.com/language).
