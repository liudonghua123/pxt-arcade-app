**Microsoft Teams** is a collaboration hub for Office 365 where Educators can organize student groups into classes with content, conversations, apps, and assignments all in one place.

You can now create MakeCode programming assignments for your students by attaching a MakeCode project. Students can then open the MakeCode editor and complete the assignment without ever leaving Teams!
