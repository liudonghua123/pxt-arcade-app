# Wires

## Prepping the buttons

Each of the buttons will need wires prepared and connected to them: 

* Connect the JST button connector cable. Those are the cables that came with your Arcade game kit with a white square plastic connector at the end (named JST connector).

* Insert 2 male jumper wires into the JST connector.

* Secure the male jumper with some electrical tape. Make sure to pull hard on the tape as you wrap it giving it some stretch so it will grab good.

* Using the wire stripper, strip one of the female jumper wires (strip off about 1/2" or 1cm).

* Attach (optional) a piece of clear tape as a label and mark the name of the button with a permanent marker. It will make wiring much easier...
* Repeat this process for **ALL** of the 7 arcade buttons.

* Grab the 7 **stripped** jumper wires and thread them together. Use electrical tape at the end of the unstripped portion to keep the wires together.

* Strip the **male** connector off of another jumper wire and thread it around the bundle of wires you just created. Use electrical tape to secure it all.

### ~ hint

#### Secure wire joints

If you have access to a soldering iron, it's a good idea to add a bit of solder where the threaded wires join to guarantee a good electrical connection that won't come apart.

## Prepping the joysticks

For each joystick, they have 4 direction switches to prepare:

* Connect the joystick cable to the **COM** and **NO** terminals of the switch.

* Connect 2 jumper wires to the JST connector.
* Strip one jumper wire for each connector.
* Repeat these steps for the terminals on **ALL** 4 of the joystick switches.

#### Tidy up the wires

You can use small zip ties to bundle wires together and avoid a spaghetti-like mess of wires.

* Join the 4 stripped jumper wires into a bundle.

* Strip the **male** connector off of one more jumper wire and connect it to the bundle.
