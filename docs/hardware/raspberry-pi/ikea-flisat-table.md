### Materials

From your local IKEA store,

* An [**IKEA FLISAT**](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/flisat-childrens-table-50298418/) from your local IKEA.
* **2 IKEA TROFAST** storage boxes.

From your electronics shop,

* A two player arcade kit: **2 5-pin joysticks** and **7 buttons** (avoid using any LED buttons or analog joysticks).
* **2 mini breadboards**.
* **Male-to-Male and Male-to-Female jumper wires** to connect the buttons to the Raspberry Pi (see later in this list).
* **Raspberry Pi Zero Kit** with a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) (Wifi/BLE not required), HDMI adapter, power supply, memory card (not all kits have one).
* **Computer monitor** with HDMI input and HDMI cable.

From your hardware store,

* **Electrical tape** to secure the jumper wires to the arcade button connectors.
* **Machine screws and bolts** to secure the joysticks.
* **Small screws** to secure the panels.

### Tools

* **Crayon or sharpie** to mark where to drill.
* **1 1/8 inch drill bit**: to drill the button and joystick holes
* **3/16 inch drill bit**: to drill the holes to secure the joystick
* (optional) **Cordless drill**: while you can drill the button holes with a manual tool, the 1 1/8" drill bit is the best at making a clean hole for the buttons. It's recommended that you use a drill if you have one and can use it safely.
* (optional) **Counter sink bit**: it will predrill a hole and a cavity for the screw heads. Pro look guaranteed!
