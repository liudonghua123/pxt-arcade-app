# Edge Connector

Some MakeCode Arcade compatible [hardware](/arcade-devices) devices have edge connectors which can add programmable pins which are accessible through the [pins](/reference/pins) namespace. The edge connector extension will map the pins of a 20-pin conncector for both analog and digital I/O.

The [Meowbit](https://www.kittenbot.cc/collections/frontpage/products/meowbit-codable-console-for-microsoft-makecode-arcade) from KittenBot is an example of a MakeCode Arcade device with an edge connector.
