# Sequencing

By calling one function after another, in sequence, you can have the program do different things in sequence.

```python-ignore
doSomething()
doAnotherThing()
```

## The pass statement

In Python, there is the concept of an *empty statement*, which is the keyword `pass` in the context where a statement is expected. The `pass` statement serves as a convenient _placeholder_ for a statement or statements
that the programmer will fill in later to complete some functionality.

```python-ignore
def myUnfinished():
    # Fill in code later to complete this function!
    pass
```
