# GitHub FAQ

## My repository looks empty

Don't forget to [commit](/github/commit) your code! You need to go to the GitHub view and click
on **commit & push** to save your changes in GitHub.

## Is there an easy way to review all the repositories from a user?

Yes, use the [Explorer](/github/explorer).

## My organization won't allow the "Microsoft MakeCode for GitHub" app?

If you can't get our GitHub app approved, use a developer token in the sign in dialog instead.
