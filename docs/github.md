# GitHub with MakeCode

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a popular web site used by developers to host and work together on code. Using the GitHub integration in MakeCode, you can easily and **freely** host your programs and collaborate on them with friends.

To use GitHub, you need an [account](https://github.com/join) and internet access.
You don't need to know anything special beyond what you've already learned in MakeCode.
